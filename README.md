# Description
The main purpose of this project is to use a gicen inspiring set of a cookie recipes and create a program that builds new recipes based off this inpsiring set. In this porject we use chocolate chip recipes that we determined to be already good cookie recipes. The cookie generator combines, adds, and removes different ingredients from each recipe in order to create a new and improved chocolate chip recipe. 

# Setup
In this project there is already a given inspiring set, but if there are other chocolate chip recipes that want to be used, simply replacing the current inspiring set and makeing sure the sytax and measurements are equivalent, can work as well. 

Next would be to simply run the program through the main.py file and watch as the cookie generator uses the inspiring set to make even better and tastier chocolate chip cookies!
